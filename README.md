### AstroHAT
## Raspberry Pi HAT for Astrophotography

This project is centered around developing a custom Raspberry Pi HAT designed to enhance astrophotography setups. It aims to streamline power management, integrate essential functionalities, and provide a platform for further expansion.

**Astrophotography**

Astrophotography is a specialized field of photography that captures celestial objects and phenomena. This often involves long exposure times, precise tracking, and specialized equipment.

**Stellarmate OS**

Stellarmate OS is a Linux distribution tailored for astrophotography. It provides a user-friendly interface and integrates with various astronomy software and hardware.

**ASCOM and INDI Protocols**

ASCOM and INDI are communication protocols widely used in astrophotography to facilitate interaction between different devices and software. ASCOM is primarily used on Windows, while INDI is platform-independent.

**Project Overview**

This custom Raspberry Pi HAT is currently under development with the following features and goals:

* **Power Management:**  Provides a centralized power solution for the Raspberry Pi and connected astrophotography devices. 
* **EEPROM:**  Includes an EEPROM for storing configuration data and other persistent information.
* **Real-Time Clock (RTC):**  Features a built-in RTC to ensure accurate timekeeping, even without an internet connection.

**Future Plans**

The project roadmap includes:

* **GPS Integration:**  Adding GPS functionality to enable precise location and time tracking.
* **Reduced Footprint:**  Optimizing the design to minimize the HAT's size and weight.
* **External USB Support:**  Including support for connecting additional USB devices.

**Current Status**

The project is actively in progress. The core functionalities of power management, EEPROM, and RTC are being developed and tested.
